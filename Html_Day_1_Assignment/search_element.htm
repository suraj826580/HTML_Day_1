      About some special Element of HTML
    </h1>
    <!------------------------- Bold ELement in HTML ------------------------->
    <h1 class="mid">b tag</h1>
    <p class="midp">
      The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's
      contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was
      formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the
      text in boldface. However, you should not use
      <!---<b> --->
      for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to
      create boldface text
    </p>

    <!------------------------- Italic Element in Html ------------------------>
    <h1 class="mid">i tag: The Idiomatic Text element</h1>
    <p class="midp">
      The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the
      normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms,
      taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been
      presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the
      <!----<i>--->
      naming of this element.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <!-------------------- Underline Element in HTML -------------------->
    <h1 class="mid">u tag: The Unarticulated Annotation (Underline) element</h1>
    <p class="midp">
      The u HTML element represents a span of inline text which should be
      rendered in a way that indicates that it has a non-textual annotation.
      This is rendered by default as a simple solid underline, but may be
      altered using CSS.
    </p>

    <!----------------------- Select Tag element in HTML ----------------------->
    <h1 class="mid">select tag: The HTML Select element</h1>
    <p class="midp">
      The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of
      options.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <!----------------------Button Tag element in HTML---------------------->
    <h1 class="mid">button tag: The Button element</h1>
    <p class="midp">
      The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with
      a mouse, keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology.
      Once activated, it then performs a programmable action, such as submitting
      a form or opening a dialog. By default, HTML buttons are presented in a
      style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change
      buttons' appearance with CSS
    </p>

    <!--------------------- Horizontal line element in HTML--------------------->
    <h1 class="mid">hr tag: The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element</h1>
    <p class="midp">
      The hr HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level
      elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic
      within a section.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <!--------------------- Break Line Tag element in HTML --------------------->
    <h1 class="mid">br tag: The Line Break element</h1>
    <p class="midp">
      The br HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is
      useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is
      significant.
